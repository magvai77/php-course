INSERT INTO `zergs` VALUES (1,'Larva','The creatures most similar to the original Zerg insectoids are the Zerg Larvae. \nEach Larva contains within it the genetic makeup of every other Zerg strain available to the Hive. \nA young Hive will have only the genetic codes for the most basic of Zerg strains, such as the Drone, but as the Hive grows and develops new structures, \nthe Larvae can expand its library of genetic strains. With a command from the Overlords, \nLarvae will enter a pupal state and begin the metamorphosis into whichever strains the Hive requires.','0'),(2,'Drone','The savage Gashyrr Wasps of Eldersthine were initially inducted into the Swarm to serve as resource gatherers. \nOver time they became Drones, engineered with the Larvae’s ability to break down their own genetic code. \nDrones can transform themselves into rudimentary Zerg structures. A mutating Drone needs creep to provide nourishment and biomass to support its new form. \nLike Larvae, Drones are controlled by the Overlords, who monitor their progress through a type of instinctive telepathy. \nDrones are single-minded about their tasks, diligently working even in the face of raging combat and the possible destruction of the Hive.','50'),(3,'Overlord','It is believed that the semi-intelligent spacefaring leviathans known as the Gargantis Proximae were first inducted into \nthe Swarm so that their heightened senses could benefit the Zerg in battle. \nWhatever their starting point, Overlords were rapidly evolved to relay commands and keep the Swarm coordinated during combat. \nThe importance of this function is underlined by the sheer number of Overlords found accompanying Zerg forces. \nOverlords are extremely flexible in their support role, often serving as advanced scouts and disgorging creep to prepare the way for further Zerg conquests. \nith the correct growth stimuli, Overlords are even capable of evolving the ability to transport Zerg warriors within their hollow carapaces.','100'),(4,'Zerling','The small, savage Dune-Runners of the sandworld Zz’gash were incorporated into the Swarm to serve as lookouts and assault troops. \nAlthough Zerglings are little more than feral animals, they work well in large groups under the command of larger Zerg. \nThe voracious Zerglings are fond of ripping enemies to shreds with their razor-sharp, sickle-like limbs and fangs. \nBecause the genetic code of the Zergling is so simple to replicate, a single Larva can spawn two separate Zerglings.','50'),(5,'Queen','During the first Zerg invasion, Queens were able to spawn a variety of parasites that infested Terran structures to create suicide troops under the Overmind’s control. \nIn the aftermath of the Brood War, the new Queens are tougher creatures who now play a limited command role nurturing Zerg nest sites. \nTheir new morphology hints at the incorporation of Terran or Protoss DNA, or perhaps even the Zerg-altered genes of the Queen of Blades herself. \nThis evolution implies that a widespread change is taking place within the Zerg hierarchy, a redistribution of power that will make the Zerg even more difficult to combat.','150'),(6,'Hydralisk','The evolutionary matrix of the caterpillar-like herbivorous Slothien was supercharged by the original Overmind, \nwho twisted the hapless creatures into nightmarish killers known as Hydralisks. \nWithin the plates of their carapaces, Hydralisks house hundreds of armor-piercing spines that can be fired in volleys at enemies approaching from ground or air. \nThe remarkable musculature of the Hydralisk (4,000 muscles compared to a Terran’s 629) can launch a Needle Spine at astounding speeds, \neasily penetrating 2 centimeters of solid neosteel even at maximum range. Under any circumstances, massed groups of Hydralisks should be approached with extreme caution, \nand preferably with Siege Tank support.','100'),(7,'Baneling','Banelings are so bloated with fluid-filled sacs that they can barely walk; \nthey have even been observed tucking into a tight ball and rolling! \nWhen a Baneling gets close enough to an enemy, it triggers a reaction within its volatile chemical payload, \ncausing the creature to explode with a shower of searing acid. The explosion destroys the Baneling but also inflicts terrible damage to its enemies. \nThe Baneling’s lethality is enhanced by the Zerg predilection for burrowing. \nAn apparently safe area can turn into a death trap as these monstrosities emerge and charge into the midst of their foes, giving little time to react.','75'),(8,'Overseer','Overseers are an evolution of the Overlord, fitted with highly evolved optical receptors that boast hypersensitive retinas. \nThese “eyes” have been through much iteration, each developmental cycle improving upon the preceding one’s optical evolution. \nThe Zerg are obsessed with detecting subtler motions and more advanced camouflage techniques, and this latest evolution allows the Overseer to detect any hidden enemy units, \nincluding those that are burrowed underground or cloaked. Perhaps most disturbing are reports that Overseers can either carry or give birth to Changelings, \ninfiltrator organisms that can convincingly mimic enemy Zerg, Terrans, or Protoss.','150'),(9,'Roach','In the years following the Brood War, Kerrigan became obsessed with the genetic codes of species with hyper-regenerative properties. \nThe most impressive example was the unassuming acidic Zantar Slug living in the humid, mountainous depths of Garrxax. \nThis tiny slug was capable of healing itself at rapid rates, and it also excreted mucus that could eat through neosteel. \nConsequently it was quickly assimilated into the Swarm. Thus the Roach was evolved, a creature that can heal itself rapidly and deliver deadly ranged acid blasts. \nIn a one-on-one battle, not much can stand against this regenerating monstrosity.','75'),(10,'Infestor','Infestors are one of the more insidious new additions to the Swarm. They were evolved from the Borbu Matriarch, \nan unusual creature that is more like an ambulatory nest than a single organism. Unlike most Zerg warriors, Infestors have the ability to move while burrowed. \nThese terrors can spew a volatile plague over their targets with dire effects, and they have been known to ingest Infested Marines, carry them to a combat zone, \nand regurgitate them to fight for the Swarm. Perhaps the Infestor’s most dangerous feature is the Neural Parasite, \na symbiotic creature living within Infestors that, when spat, attaches to an enemy and controls its mind for a short period of time. \nSeeing the immense potential of this parasite, the Queen of Blades is busy incubating new strains that can live longer outside of their host.','100'),(11,'Mutalisk','The Mutalisk has changed little from its original incarnation as the spacefaring Mantis Screamer of the desolate Dinares sector. \nMutalisks form the primary flying force of the Zerg, \nmaking hit-and-run attacks against vulnerable installations and wheeling across the skies in prodigious numbers above Zerg Hives or land-based forces. \nMutalisks are agile and dangerous opponents. They can attack foes both in the air and on the ground by expelling a voracious symbiote known as the Glave Wurm, \nwhich can rapidly strike at several opponents as it explosively disintegrates. In large numbers or against weak defenses, Mutalisks are a deadly threat.','100'),(12,'Corruptor','Protoss and Terran forces alike deeply fear Corruptors. \nFortunately these giant brain-like creatures, with their snapping beaks and dangling tentacles, are usually found near only the most advanced Hive clusters. \nThe Corruptor is a genetic marvel that can cover targets in acid, causing them to take additional damage from attacks.','150'),(13,'Nydus Worm','The Nydus Worm is an evolution of the Zerg Nydus Canal, a subterranean organic structure that interlinked areas covered by creep. \nNydus Worms live inside a nest-like structure called the Nydus Network. \nA Nydus Worm can travel from the Network to any nearby location before emerging, in the process creating a tunnel beneath the battlefield. \nThis huge creature is capable of stretching itself out to prodigious lengths to support the tunnel with its own skin and ribs. \nZerg warriors can enter the tunnel via either the Worm’s head or the Nydus Network, \nand they can travel through the Worm at great speed due to a combination of peristaltic motion and chemical stimulants that direct their movements. \nNydus Worms pose a grave threat to areas previously thought to be secure.','100'),(14,'Ultralisk','Bearing little resemblance to the docile Brontoliths from which they were evolved, Ultralisks are the most powerful of the Zerg ground forces. \nThey serve as the backbone of the Swarm’s armies and are as dangerous as any armored vehicle. \nThese massive monstrosities are used as living battering rams against their enemies. Their large bone-like scythes allow them to tear through most known substances with ease. \nThe Ultralisk’s genetic material has been subjected to countless tests and experiments, \nand only the final viable code is used by Zerg Larvae to morph into new Ultralisks.','300'),(15,'Brood Lord','These massive manta-like flying creatures serve as aerial siege units for the Swarm. \nOnly seen in the largest of conflicts, the Brood Lord has the ability to spit out biological symbiotes that function as living ammunition. \nThese regurgitated creatures focus on their target, ravaging it until they destroy it or die in the attempt. \nThis attack makes Brood Lords extremely dangerous to opposing installations. However, despite their impressive offensive abilities, \nBrood Lords are not very durable, and they make easy targets for most aerial-strike combatants.','150'),(16,'Swarm host','The Swarm Host has no weapons of its own, but can represent an army unto itself. \nGenerated by the Infestation Pit, it spawns parasitic symbiotes known as Locusts, which attack any nearby enemies with volleys of acidic saliva. \nThis crawling monstrosity burrows into the ground in order to provide a seemingly endless supply of ferocious biological minions, and is often used in defensive maneuvers. \nThis lack of mobility can leave the Swarm Host vulnerable to quicker enemies with area damage like the Hellion.','200'),(17,'Viper','Carrying on in the support role once held by the Zerg Defiler, \nthe Viper combines several vicious biological weapons to weaken enemy forces and give an edge to the Swarm. \nThis winged menace stores a thick microbial soup within its abdomen, \nand can spray the viscous mixture into the air whenever ranged foes approach – essentially nullifying the effectiveness of their armaments until they can move out of the cloying mist. \nEnemies hoping to escape to high ground are quickly snatched from their dominant position by the Viper’s muscular proboscis, \nallowing the zerg to counter just about any tactical terrain advantage. When fatigued, the Viper can siphon bioelectrical energy and nutrients from other Zerg buildings, \nallowing it to quickly return to the fray and cause further mayhem.','100'),(18,'Ravager','The Ravager is the result of years of twisting and fine-tuning the genome of the Roach far beyond its biological limitations. \nThis monstrosity wields plasma fire both in close-quarters combat and as a wedge to crack open entrenched positions, \nsomething the Swarm has struggled with in the past. Its heavier frame isn’t subtle, but, with the ability to launch gobs of Corrosive Bile at distant targets, \nthe Ravager is an intelligent evolutionary adaptation to the challenges the Zerg face on the battlefield.','100'),(19,'Lurker','Lurkers are subterranean creatures which were evolved to deal with ground threats. \nThey are rarely seen above ground—and were believed lost after the Brood War—but recent intelligence reports indicate that Lurker presence is on the rise throughout the Koprulu sector. \nThis peculiar Zerg strain can only attack from within the soil, \nusing high-density extendable spines to tear through flesh and neosteel—and evoking sheer terror in the hearts of the Swarm’s enemies.','150');
